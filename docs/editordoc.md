The editor is a main part of the project

Build with pixi js[(https://pixijs.com/)] it can handle the 2d map easily
Map will handle Tiled json data type. The game engine/renderer used for the game part is Phaser.js
and it needs tiled json as the input for loading the game. Editor will handle the export and import of the json data.

Editor is builded after refering the JSON Map format[(https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/json-map-format/#json-layer)] to make the output from the editor compactable with the phaser input
